    </span></h3><span>1) Get in contact with one of the club members, to : get the printed posters and/or  table tents and to obtain a list of members (and their email address), who will help you with with distributing.</span><br />
      <br />
      2) Brainstorm and make a list of buildings (academic and non-academic), where the table tents and posters will be displayed e.g. Dining halls, kendade, clapp, library, elevators etc. Choose places where displays are easily noticed.<br />
      <br />
      3) Decide, how many posters are required for each building. for example, 10 for clapp, 3 for library and so on. You may have to be in touch with the person who printed the posters.<br />
      <br />
      4) Once you have the list of the buildings and the people who will be doing the distributing, assign each one person to cover a one or two particular building. How you divide is up to you but make sure it is efficient. Make sure you communicate with people effectively, so that they know exactly which buildings are assigned to them<br />
      <br />
      5) Once you, obtain the printed posters, it is also your duty to get the posters to those who will be distributing.<br />
      <br />
      6) Always stay in touch with one of the club board members (my email address is shams20r), and let her know what you have decided, so she can also help you with some of you decisions. for example, if you are not sure that you have covered all the buildings, talk to the board member for a double check.<br />
      <br />
      7) Also, make sure that the people who will distributing the posters/table tents lets you know after they are done.<br />
      <br />
      Distributing posters takes at most 2 days (to cover all buildings). But the actual time you have to spend on usually is not more than 4 hours in total. Most of your time will most likely be spend, contacting people and receiving feedback from them.
